## Curto Circuito (Blocks)

A FSE theme for Curto Circuito's website. Because it is still a very recent technology and does not have some important aspects (such as the possibility to show or hide elements based on media queries), the development of this project is paused â€” but not abandoned.

The development of this theme will resume when it is possible to show and hide elements of the frontend through media queries and the number of blocks is greater, mainly for the creation of other areas of the visual that are not exactly the page content - such as blocks to compose headers and footers, for example.
